      <p>
        In 2021, Stewart and Jarmila Peck established the Stewart and Jarmila
        Peck Collection Enhancement Endowment (the Peck Fund) with the Center
        for Systematic Entomology (CSE). The primary purpose of the endowment is
        to help students and researchers travel to the Florida State Collection
        of Arthropods (FSCA) to work with and ultimately improve the
        collections.
