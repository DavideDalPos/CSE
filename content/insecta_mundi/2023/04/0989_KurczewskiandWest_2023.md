abstract: 'The use of common names for species and subspecies of North American spider wasps (Hymenoptera: Pompilidae) presents a variety of questions for pompilid specialists as most pompilid taxa are difficult to identify, even under the microscope. Some common names currently being used for spider wasp species are acceptable while others are misleading, unfit and unacceptable. Opinions on the relative value of common names for spider wasps from current Pompilidae researchers are given in the Introduction. Eleven inappropriate common names for North American Pompilidae species and subspecies are identified and discussed in the Results.'
