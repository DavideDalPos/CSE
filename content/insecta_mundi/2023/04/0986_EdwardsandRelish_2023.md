abstract: 'Use of a combination of a novel pitfall trap setup and Lindgren funnel traps at Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park resulted in the collection of few specimens due to a higher than normal ground water level. Despite this, some unusual specimens of Arachnida and Diplopoda were found, including the second known record of <i>Mysmena incredula </i>Gertsch and Davis, 1936 (Araneae: Mysmenidae) in Florida.'
