abstract: 'A total of 31 species of stored grain insects belonging to 27 genera, 12 families and two orders were collected from rice processing complexes (RPCs) in South Korea during the period 2021–2024. These included 26 species (84%) of Coleoptera belonging to 10 families and five species (16%) of Lepidoptera belonging to two families. Among populations of <i>Tribolium castaneum </i>(Herbst), the results of discriminating dose tests revealed that one population collected from Eumseong, Chungcheongbukdo (CB) contained phosphine-resistant individuals, with a survival rate of 90.3% at the discriminating dose of phosphine. Meanwhile, all tested <i>Sitophilus oryzae </i>(Linnaeus) individuals were found to be susceptible. Thus, the list of insect species documented in this study may serve as a valuable resource for the management of economically important stored grain pests occurring in RPCs.'
