abstract: 'A new species of <i>Tetraleurodes</i> Cockerell (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha: Aleyrodidae), <i>T. gilli</i>, occurring
on <i>Quercus</i> L. (Fagaceae) in California is described and illustrated based on its puparium, adults,
and nymphs. The puparium of the new species can be recognized from that of other black whiteflies devoid
of dorsal wax that occur on oaks by the combination of a filamentous marginal wax fringe as wide as a third
to full width of puparium, cephalothoracic setal formula 1 0 1 1, longitudinal suture margined by tubercles,
presence of eyespots, a concentric dorsal submarginal fold, ventral spinules medially to legs decreasing in
size from large to small medially, sides not deflexed ventrally, and absence of dorsal submarginal papillae, of
dorsomedial tubercles on each abdominal segment, and of dorsomedial clusters of pores on fourth abdominal
segment. A key to all species of whiteflies with black puparia known to occur on oaks in North America
is provided.'
