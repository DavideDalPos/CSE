abstract: 'A clearwing moth species, <i>Paranthrene sogaardi </i>Taft and Smith, 2024, new species, is described from Michigan and Minnesota. The recognition of this new species is based on a phylogeny estimated from mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I and wingless DNA sequences of 25 specimens representing all <i>Paran¬threne </i>Hübner species including individuals from various locations. <i>Paranthrene sogaardi </i>new species was monophyletic and differed from <i>Paranthrene tabaniformis </i>Rottenburg, 1775 by a mean of 7.6% COI pairwise “p” distance, coloration, and genitalic morphology.'
