abstract: 'In this fauna! study 248 species and subspecies of Scarabaeidae are recorded from Florida. Only the Laparosticti, representing 115 species and subspecies, are treated in detail, although a checklist is provided for the entire family. Keys are presented for the identification of all taxonomic units, with many of the morphological characters illustrated by line drawings or stereoscan photographs. Habitus drawings are presented for one representative of each of the 32 genera of Florida Laparosticti. Data are presented for each species in the following format: synonymy, diagnosis, taxonomic notes, distribution and zoogeography, biology, specimens examined, and selected references. Distribution maps, showing detailed Florida records and the general range, are provided for all species. Data from well over 1 million specimens are presented in tabular form in the appendices. The bibliography contains 643 references. Numerous habitat photographs are included. The following taxonomic changes are made: <i>Aphodius geomysi </i>Cartwright is synonymized under <i>Aphodius aegrotus </i>Hom; <i>Peltotrupes pro/undus dubius </i>Howden is synonymized under <i>Peltotrupes profundus </i>Howden; <i>Phanaeus vindex cyanellus </i>Robinson and <i>Phanaeus difformis magnificens </i>Robinson are synonymized under <i>Phanaeus vindex </i>MacLeay.'
