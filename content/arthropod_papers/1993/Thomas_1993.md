abstract: 'The Florida species of the cucujoid families Silvanidae, Passandridae, and Laemophloeidae are reviewed. Keys and illustrations for all Florida genera and species and diagnoses and detailed distribution records for all noneconomic species in the state are provided. A key to the genera of the United States is also provided, as is a checklist of species. There are 14 genera and 33 species of Silvanidae in the United States, 1 I genera and 22 species of which occur in Florida. Of the two U.S. genera and four species of Cucujidae, none occurs in Florida. Two genera and two species of Passandridae occur in the U.S., including Florida. The Laemophloeidae are represented by 14 genera and 53 species in the U.S., of which 11 genera and 31 species are recorded from Florida. One new species, <i>Laemophloeus woodruffi, </i>is described. New combinations proposed are: <i>Charaphloeus bituberculatus </i>(Reitter) (from <i>Laemophloeus); Charaphloeus flavosignatus </i>(Schaeffer) (from <i>Laemophloeus); Parandrita permixtus </i>(Grouvelle) (from <i>Laemophloeus); Phloeolaemus chamaeropis </i>(Schwarz) (from <i>Laemophloeus); Phloeolaemus quiquearticulatus </i>(Grouvelle) (from <i>Laemophloeus); Phloeolaemus macrocephalus </i>(Schaeffer) (from <i>Laemophloeus). </i>New synonyms proposed <i>are:Laemophloeus megacephalus </i>Grouvelle = <i>L. jloridanus </i>Casey; <i>Charaphloeus convexulus </i>(LeConte) = <i>C.filiger </i>Casey and <i>C. sphaerops </i>Casey; <i>Charaphloeus adustus </i>(LeConte) = <i>C.fraterculus </i>Casey; <i>Lathropus pictus </i>Schwarz= <i>L. costatus </i>Grouvelle. A lectotype is designated for <i>Laemophloeus megacephalus </i>Grouvelle. <i>Dysmerus caseyi </i>(Grouvelle) is revived from synonymy under <i>Dysmerus basalis </i>Casey.'
