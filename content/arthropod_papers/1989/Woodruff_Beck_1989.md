abstract: 'In this faunal study, data are presented for 54 species of <i>Phyllophaga </i>recorded from Florida. Two new species, <i>pseudofloridana </i>and <i>skelleyi, </i>are described, and 9 other species are recorded from the State for the first time: <i>anxia </i>LeConte, <i>apicata Reinhard,forbesi </i>Glasgow <i>,foxii </i>Davis, <i>implicita </i>Hom, <i>per/onga </i>Davis, <i>profunda </i>Blanchard, <i>puberula </i>Du Val, and <i>yemasseei </i>Cartwright. In addition, illustrations are provided for the first time of the female genitalia for 4 species: <i>c/emens </i>Hom, <i>e/izoria </i>Saylor, <i>georgiana </i>Horn, and <i>okeechobea </i>Robinson. Two species <i>[P. murrea </i>Sanderson, previously known from a unique female, under <i>P. e/ongata </i>Linell, and <i>P. vanalleri </i>Schaeffer, originally described as a subspecies of <i>obso/eta, </i>under <i>obso/eta </i>(Blanchard)] are synonymized. Scanning electron microscope photographs are provided for the male (4 or 5 views) and female (2 views) genitalia, as well as other relevant taxonomic characters. Data are presented for each species under the following headings: synonymy, type locality, diagnosis, description, taxonomic notes, distribution (Florida and United States), biology and ecology, adult host plants, immatures, specimens examined, and selected references. Maps showing both Florida and United States distribution are provided for each species. Keys are provided for the adults of 54 species, and for the known larvae of 23 species. Eight tables provide: 1) an alphabetical checklist of figures and maps; 2) a chronological list of Florida <i>Phyllophaga </i>descriptions; 3) the arrangement by ''groups'' of various authors; 4) a summary chart of life cycle data; 5) an alphabetical list and references to known larvae of Florida species; 6) a list of 17 misspelled names of Florida species, and their citations; 7) an annotated alphabetical checklist of the 96 names used for Florida species; and 8) a summary of 22 basic taxonomic character states. Specimen label data are listed in the Appendices (1-39) as is a list of the figures (40), and the Bibliography contains 376 references.'
