abstract: 'Spiders (order Araneae) are among the most diverse and ecologically significant groups of arthropods, with over 53,000 described species worldwide. Florida’s unique geographical position makes it a key region for understanding spider diversity in North America. Here we provide the first comprehensive checklist of Florida spiders, integrating historical literature, records from the Florida State Collection of Arthropods (FSCA), and more recent fieldwork. Distribution records by county are provided, species known to be adventive or of uncertain origin are indicated, and undescribed species are documented where known. We find a total of 834 species for Florida, though this falls short of the predicted 900+ species based on regional richness and habitat diversity. This discrepancy may be, in part, a result of under-sampling in Florida’s panhandle and limited revisionary work in hyper-diverse families with many undescribed taxa. The checklist also highlights the growing number of exotic species in the state, though most appear confined to synanthropic or disturbed habitats. This foundational checklist lays the groundwork for advancing future research in taxonomy, ecology, biogeography, and conservation.'
