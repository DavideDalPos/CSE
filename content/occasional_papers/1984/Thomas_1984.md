abstract: 'The New World species belonging to <i>Placonotus </i>Macleay are revised and keys, illustrations, and descriptions are provided. Thirteen species are recorded from the New World, including 6 new species and 2 Old World species. A third Old World species is included also to permit its identification should it be discovered in the New World. The following new species are described: <i>Placonotus macrognathus </i>(U.S.A. and Cuba), <i>P. planijrons </i>(Lesser Antilles), <i>P. patruelis </i>(Guatemala), <i>P. arizonensis</i> (U.S.A.), <i>P. pseudomodestus </i>(South America), and <i>P. maya </i>(Guatemala and Mexico). <i>Laemoph/oeus zimmermanni </i>Leconte is revived from synonymy and transferred to <i>Placonotus. </i>Other new combinations are: <i>P. pallentipennis </i>(Grouvelle), <i>P. modestus </i>(Say), and <i>P. infimus </i>(Sharp). The following names are synonymized: <i>Silvanophloeus apertus </i>Casey, <i>S. illustris </i>Casey, and <i>S. sobrinus </i>Casey ( = <i>P. zimmermanni </i>(Leconte)); <i>Laemophloeus victus </i>Kessel and <i>L. commixtus </i>Grouvelle ( = <i>P. politissimus </i>(Wollaston)); <i>Silvanophloeus /iquidus </i>Casey and <i>Laemophloeus gundlachi </i>Grouvelle ( <i>=P. modestus </i>(Say)). Lectotypes are designated where possible, and one neotype, for <i>Cucujus modestus </i>Say, is proposed. The structure of the adults, especially that of the male genitalia, is reviewed, species groups are characterized, and phylogenetic relationships are discussed.'
