            For the past 35+ years the <b>Center for Systematic Entomology (CSE)</b> has served as a non-profit organization 
            designed to further systematics in its broadest sense. It has supported the <a href="https://thefsca.org" target="_blank" class="fsca-link">Florida State Collection of Arthropods (FSCA)</a> 
            The CSE has also provided a number of grants for specialists to study at the FSCA. Because the Research Associate program supports insect systematics 
            in many of the same ways, we believe that membership in CSE provides another way that Research Associates can assist.
