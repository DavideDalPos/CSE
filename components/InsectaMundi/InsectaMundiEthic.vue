            <b><i>Insecta Mundi (IM)</i></b> is an academic journal published by the Center for Systematic Entomology (CSE). 
            The integrity of the articles published in IM is of utmost importance and should be ensured during all steps of manuscript processing. 
            Thus, all the people involved with IM publication, including authors, peer reviewers, review editors, 
            layout editors, and members of the editorial board, are expected to fully adhere to all of our policies 
            regarding publication ethics and malpractice. We have adopted many of the policies proposed by the 
            <a href="https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt/ethics"  target="_blank" class="external-link">European Journal of Taxonomy</a> 
            which are listed below with modification as needed.

    <b><i>Insecta Mundi (IM)</i></b> manuscripts must be original and adhere to a high scientific and technical standard. 
    All images contained within manuscripts must either be original or used with expressed permission of the images' owner.

            When new material has been collected for the purposes of the study, the authors must ensure that all 
            necessary permits have been obtained prior to collecting. Although we do not require reviewers and editors to independently
            verify that permits were obtained, if they have reason to believe that new material was obtained illegally, they are responsible
            for notifying the chief editor.

            The authors are required to deposit all type material in an institutional collection and to

                <li><b>Unique submission:</b> If authors submit a manuscript to Insecta Mundi,

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Authors must obtain critical reviews from two outside reviewers. Those review comments and Reviewer Report forms (signed by the peer reviewers) 
                must be submitted with the manuscript. Peer reviewers are not anonymous, and their contributions must be acknowledged in the 
                Acknowledgments section of the manuscript. Authors are responsible for obtaining reviews from peer reviewers that have sufficient 
                expertise in the subject/s of the manuscript. If an editor believes that these reviews were unsatisfactory, they can request that the authors 
                seek out additional peer reviewers, or they can solicit additional reviews on their own.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Authors are expected to contribute to their research field by publishing original and relevant results and data. 
                The following elements are considered essential for an ethical publication: data integrity; sound presentation of methodologies, 
                sources and techniques used; reproducibility of results; acknowledgment of contributors to data collection and research; 
                acknowledgments of funding agencies and/or previous institutions where (part of) the work was carried out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Authors must cite appropriate and relevant literature in support of the results presented in their manuscript. 
                Plagiarism is unacceptable; any suspicion of plagiarism will be investigated by the editors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Self-plagiarism (also known as text recycling) should be avoided as much as possible; however, when text duplication from previous works is necessary, 
                it is then reported transparently and these previous works are fully cited in the publication itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whenever possible, data and results gathered in the same framework (<i>e.g., </i> a single research project) should not be broken up 
                into smaller publishable units. We encourage authors to publish their data and results obtained in a single framework as a unique and 
                original publication.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Invention of data and malicious manipulation of data (including figures) are unacceptable. 
                If there is conclusive evidence that authors have done this, their manuscript will be immediately and summarily rejected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Illustrations used to present data should not be manipulated, except for clarity purposes (e.g. adjustment of the contrast, colors…). 
                Authors are responsible for mentioning this image manipulation in the Materials and Methods section and/or in the figure captions if they 
                believe that this manipulation could lead to misinterpretation of data.

                There is a conflict of interest when authors are influenced in their choices or actions by a personal or financial interest. 
                Any suspicions of conflicts of interest should be reported to the IM editors or to the CSE officers.
