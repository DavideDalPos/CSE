                    As of 2007, <b><i>Insecta Mundi</i></b> (paper ISSN 0749-6737, CD-ROM ISSN 1942-1362, online ISSN 1942-1354) 
                    was published on paper irregularly throughout the year. As manuscripts are completed and published,

                    In 2014, manuscript submissions to <b><i>Insecta Mundi</i></b> has grown to a volume that we suffered a staffing crisis 
                    and had to reorganize our manuscript processing. The primarily difference is that we increased the number of volunteer
                    Editors and changed manuscript submission requirements. Our current editorial staff is listed also
