            From 1985 to 2006, <b><i>Insecta Mundi</i></b> was produced with yearly volume numbers and printed on paper quarterly. 
            As of 2007, <b><i>Insecta Mundi</i></b> (paper ISSN 0749-6737, CD-ROM ISSN 1942-1362, online ISSN 1942-1354) 
            was published on paper irregularly throughout the year. As manuscripts are completed and published, 
            they are individually, sequentially numbered. There are no longer year-based volume or issue numbers. 
            Further details about our policies and procedures can be found in

            Recent changes in the <a href="https://www.iczn.org/the-code/the-code-online/"  target="_blank" class="external-link">International 
                Code of Zoological Nomenclature</a>, starting in 2012, allowed 
            <b><i>Insecta Mundi</i></b>'s open accessible electronic publication to be the form validating each articles publication date. 
            In 2014, manuscript submissions to <b><i>Insecta Mundi</i></b> has grown to a volume that we suffered a staffing crisis 
            and had to reorganize our manuscript processing. The primarily difference is that we increased the number of volunteer
             Editors and changed manuscript submission requirements. Our current staff is listed <a href="/editorialstaff" class="internal-link">here</a>.
