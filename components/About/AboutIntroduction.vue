        The Center for Systematic Entomology (CSE) is composed of dedicated individuals who support research and publishing in insect systematics.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The CSE is led by four elected <strong>Officers</strong>—President, Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary—who serve one-year terms and 
        may be re-elected. Together, these officers also form the <strong>Executive Committee</strong>. 
        All officers are members of the <strong>Board of Directors</strong>, which guides the organization’s mission and activities.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In addition to the Executive Committee, the <strong>Board of Members</strong> includes individuals who serve two-year 
        terms and contribute to governance and strategic planning.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We also have editorial teams for our flagship journal, <strong>Insecta Mundi</strong>, and the <strong>Gifts, Grants, and Endowments (GGE) Committee</strong>, 
        which is appointed by the Board of Directors. The GGE Committee develops and recommends policies related to donations, tangible gifts, 
        and grant administration to ensure long-term sustainability.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The <strong>Board of Directors</strong> typically meets four times a year. The CSE also holds an <strong>annual business meeting</strong> during the <strong>CSE Annual Conference</strong>.
