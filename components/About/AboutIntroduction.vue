        The Center for Systematic Entomology (CSE) is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the study and dissemination of insect systematics.

      <p>
        Our community is composed of dedicated Officers and a diverse Board of Members representing a wide 
        range of professional backgroundsâ€”from academic researchers and museum curators to field entomologists and amateur experts.

        Together, we support research, publication, and collaboration in the global 
        entomological community through projects like <em>Insecta Mundi</em> and our active support for taxonomic work.
